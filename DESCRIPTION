Description: sfcentral package is a collection of functions for computing 
    centrographic statistics (central points, standard distance, standard deviation 
    ellipse, standard deviation box) for observations taken at point locations 
    in 2D or 3D. The sfcentral library was inspired in aspace package but 
    conceived to be used in a spatial tidyverse context.
