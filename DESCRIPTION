Description: aspace2 package is a fork of aspace package from Randy Bui, Ron N. 
    Buliung and Tarmo K. Remmel (2012). Like these, aspace2 package contains the
    same collection of functions for computing centrographic statistics (e.g., 
    standard distance, standard deviation ellipse, standard deviation box) for 
    observations taken at point locations in 2D or 3D. The aspace2 library was 
    conceived to avoid the default output assigns and file writings. This is 
    primarilly intended to be used in a tidy* context, (e.g in `dplyr::groupy_by`,
    `dplyr::summarise`, `dplyr::mutate`, etc, contexts).
